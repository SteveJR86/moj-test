# Ministry of Justic Coding Challenge

## Description

I've built this project for submission as part of a job application for the
Ministry of Justice.
The project is a basic task manager allowing users create, update, view and 
remove tasks, where each task has a title, description, status and due date/time.

## Architecture

The project has a React frontend, C# .NET backend and PostgreSQL database all 
of which are within docker containers for easy development and deployment.

## Installation

Details to be clarified as project progresses

## Running the project locally

## Tips for running the project for live users

Details to be clarified as project progresses.
TODO: research whether React frontend should be sat behind a reverse proxy such
as nginx or apache for production use.
