# Project Plan

As I'm starting this on 27/09/2025 for submission on 30/09/2025 I'm going to write
out my full plan and see how far I can get before I need to submit. This will act
as a good tracking tool and provide me with a roadmap for future development.

## To Do

1. Get skeleton weather-forecast API running in C# within docker.
2. Get skeleton React app running using Vite within docker.
3. Ensure frontend and backend can communicate while running in docker.
4. Get Postgres running in docker with two task entries.
5. Develop /tasks GET request to return all tasks.
6. Develop /tasks?id=<number> or /tasks/:id request to return a single task by id.
7. Develop /tasks/id PATCH to update status of existing task
8. Develop /tasks/id DELETE to delete task
