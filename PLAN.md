# Project Plan

As I'm starting this on 27/09/2025 for submission on 30/09/2025 I'm going to write
out my full plan and see how far I can get before I need to submit. This will act
as a good tracking tool and provide me with a roadmap for future development.

## To Do

[x] 1. Get skeleton API running in C# within docker.
[x] 2. Get MongoDB running in docker.
[x] 3. Ensure that backend can communicate with DB.
[x] 4. Develop /tasks POST request to add a new task and return an id number
(perhaps?) - Doesn't currently return ID number. Will revisit if this becomes an issue.
[x] 5. Develop /tasks GET request to return all tasks.
[x] 6. Develop /tasks?id=<number> or /tasks/:id request to return a single task by id.
[x] 7. Develop /tasks/id PUT to update status of existing task
[x] 8. Develop /tasks/id DELETE to delete task
[x] 9. Get skeleton React app running using Vite within docker.
[x] 10. Ensure frontend and backend can communicate while running in docker.
[x] 11. Create tasks table
[x] 12. Create modal for entering and updating tasks
[ ] 13. Add form validation
[ ] 14. Add backend validation (As you can't trust anything from the client)
[ ] 15. Add frontend error handling.
[ ] 16. Add backend error handling.
[ ] 17. Make layout suitable for mobile view.
[ ] 18. Conduct accessibility testing and resolve any issues found.
[ ] 19. Add frontend testing using cypress.
[ ] 20. Investigate suitable testing library for backend.
